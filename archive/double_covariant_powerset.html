    <h1> Powerset dreams </h1>

    In this post I give informal reasoning to why there is
    monad structure on the
    covariant powerset functor composed with itself.
    This informal reasoning is from a viewpoint of modelling
    systems coalgebraically.

    <h2> Motivation </h2>

    <p>
    A system with states and transitions is naturally modelled
    by a function
    \(f:X\to F(X)\)
    from a set \(X\), to an augmented version of \(X\), called \(F(X)\).
    The set \(X\) contains our states, and an element \(f(x)\)
    tells us how the system evolves from a state \(x\).
    A core operation in standard set theory is taking the powerset
    of set 
    which sends a set to a set of subsets.
    $$ \{x_1,x_2\}\mapsto \{\emptyset,\{x_1\},\{x_2\},\{x_1,x_2\}\}$$
    When we take \(F\) to be the powerset operation, denoted \(P\),
    we find we model, albeit basic, systems which involve a choice
    at each step: <em> possiblistic systems </em> if you will.
    $$ f:X\to P(X) $$
    This powerset operation is very well-behaved,
    so can be equipped with many additional structures.
    In particular, it is a functor and a monad.
    In our interpretation, being a monad gives us a monoid
    of possiblistic systems:
    we can <em>compose</em> possibilistic systems with an operation
    \( ; \), which has a unit \(\eta\).
    $$ (f;g);h=f;(g;h)\hspace{3em} \eta;f=f\hspace{3em} f;\eta=f $$
    This is equivalent to the transitive closure operation on relations,
    i.e. \({\bf Kl}(P)\cong{\bf Rel}\) being a category.
    In pictures, composition is given by a glue and a flatten:
    </p>

    <p>
    $$ f;g := (X\xrightarrow{f}P(X)\xrightarrow{Pg}PP(X)\xrightarrow{\mu}PX) $$
    <p>
    It's worth mentioning about that the dual interpretation of
    function
    $$ f:X\to P(X) $$
    which I will call non-deterministic,
    is that all transitions are taken simultaneously.
    Thus an evolution from a state \(x\), will result
    being in states in \(f(x)\) <b>at the same time</b>.
    Flatten is given by 
    $$ f;g = (X\xrightarrow{f}P(X)\xrightarrow{Pg}PP(X)\xrightarrow{\bigcap}P(X) $$
    We have that \(\eta\) is a left unit to the composition,
    a
    however does not have a right unit.
    Even more worryingly, the composition is not even associative.
    The most we can say is that:
    $$ (f;g);h\le f;(g;h)\hspace{3em} \eta;f=f\hspace{3em}f;\eta\le f$$
    where \(\le\) is subset order lifted pointwise.
    This doesn't seem like a particularly useful structure.
    <h3> The Problem </h3>
    Now, what
    if we consider the powerset functor composed with itself.
    In line with our first interpretation of a single powerset,
    we can think of a state \(f:X\to PP(X)\) as giving
    each state a set of choices, which are now subsets themselves.
    Once a subset is chosen, we will interpret ourselves has being
    non-deterministically inside that subset.
    Our systems transition involve possiblistic branching alternating
    with non-deterministic branching.

    Unfortunately, it is known that monad fail to compose, and in particular
    there is no monad struc
